**Asseco BERIT GmbH, Mannheim** • Jan. 2022 - Present

Since January 2022, I have been working at Asseco BERIT GmbH, located in Mannheim, Germany. I mainly work remotely due to my study location. The company operates globally with a focus on Geographic Information Systems and workflow management. My work is focused on the GIS solutions offered. Depending on current needs, I work on data models, thematic layers, or web GIS applications. Through this work, I have gained a broader understanding of GIS.
