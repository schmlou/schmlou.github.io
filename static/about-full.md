## About Me

I'm Louis Schmalisch, a Master's student at Z_GIS, University of Salzburg, specializing in Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing.

## Background

My journey into geoinformatics began during my undergraduate studies, where I discovered the powerful intersection of geography, technology, and environmental science. This passion led me to pursue advanced studies at Z_GIS, one of Europe's leading centers for Geographic Information Science.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on the application of remote sensing and GIS technologies to address pressing environmental challenges. I'm particularly interested in:

- Environmental monitoring using satellite imagery and drone technology
- Spatial analysis for climate change adaptation and mitigation
- Machine learning applications in geospatial data processing
- Urban planning and sustainable development using GIS

## Current Work

At Z_GIS, I'm working on cutting-edge projects that combine traditional GIS methodologies with modern data science techniques. My work involves processing large-scale geospatial datasets, developing automated workflows for environmental monitoring, and creating interactive visualizations to communicate complex spatial patterns.

## Technical Skills

I'm proficient in various GIS software platforms (QGIS, ArcGIS) and programming languages (Python, R, JavaScript) for geospatial analysis. My toolkit includes specialized libraries like GDAL, GeoPandas, and various remote sensing packages that enable me to tackle complex spatial problems.

## Beyond Academia

When I'm not analyzing spatial data, I enjoy exploring the beautiful landscapes around Salzburg, photography, and contributing to open-source GIS projects. I believe in the power of open data and open-source software to democratize access to geospatial technologies.

## Collaboration

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow researchers, practitioners, and students in the GIS community. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss potential collaborations, share ideas, or simply chat about all things geospatial!
